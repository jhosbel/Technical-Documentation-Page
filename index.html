            <p>In software development and product management, a user story is an informal, 
                natural language description of one or more features of a software system. 
                User stories are often written from the perspective of an end user or user of a 
                system. They are often recorded on index cards, on Post-it notes, or digitally in 
                project management software Depending on the project, user stories may be written 
                by various stakeholders including clients, users, managers, or development 
                team members.</p>

            <p>User stories are a type of boundary object. They facilitate sensemaking and 
                communication; that is, they help software teams organize their understanding 
                of the system and its context.</p>

            <p>User stories are written by or for users or customers to influence the functionality 
                of the system being developed. In some teams, the product manager 
                (or product owner in Scrum), is primarily responsible for formulating user stories 
                and organizing them into a product backlog. In other teams, anyone can write a user 
                story. User stories can be developed through discussion with stakeholders, based on 
                personas or simply made up.</p>

            <header class="titulos-2">Common templates</header>
            <p>User stories may follow one of several formats or templates.</p>
            <p>The most common is the Connextra template, stated below. Mike Cohn suggested the "so that" clause is optional although still often helpful.</p>
            <p class="caja-gris">As a &#60;role&#62; I can &#60;capability&#62;, so that &#60;receive benefit&#62;</p>
            <p>Chris Matts suggested that "hunting the value" was the first step in successfully delivering software, and proposed this alternative:</p>
            <p class="caja-gris">In order to &#60;receive benefit&#62; as a &#60;role&#62;, I can &#60;goal/desire&#62;</p>
            <p>Another template based on the Five Ws specifies:</p>
            <p class="caja-gris">As &#60;who&#62; &#60;when&#62; &#60;where&#62;, I &#60;want&#62; because &#60;why&#62;</p>

        <section class="main-section" id="Usage">
            <header class="titulos">Usage</header>
            <p>As a central part of many agile development methodologies, such as in XP's planning 
                game, user stories describe what may be built in the software project. User stories 
                are prioritized by the customer (or the product owner in Scrum) to indicate which 
                are most important for the system and will be broken down into tasks and estimated 
                by the developers. One way of estimating is via a Fibonacci scale.</p>

            <p>When user stories are about to be implemented, the developers should have the possibility 
                to talk to the customer about it. The short stories may be difficult to interpret, may require 
                some background knowledge or the requirements may have changed since the story was written.</p>

            <p>User stories can be expanded to add detail based on these conversations. 
                This can include notes, attachments and acceptance criteria.</p>
        </section>
        <section class="main-section" id="Acceptance_criteria">
            <header class="titulos-2">Acceptance criteria</header>
            <p>Mike Cohn defines acceptance criteria as "notes about what the story must do in order 
                for the product owner to accept it as complete." They define the boundaries of a user 
                story and are used to confirm when a story is completed and working as intended.</p>

            <p>The appropriate amount of information to be included in the acceptance criteria varies by 
                team, program and project. Some may include 'predecessor criteria', "The user has already logged 
                in and has already edited his information once". Some may write the acceptance criteria 
                in typical agile format, Given-When-Then. Others may simply use bullets points taken from 
                original requirements gathered from customer or stakeholders.</p>

            <p>In order for a story to be considered done or complete, all acceptance criteria must be met.</p>

        <section class="main-section" id="Benefits">
            <header class="titulos">Benefits</header>
            <p>There is no good evidence that using user stories increases software success or 
                developer productivity. However, user stories facilitate sensemaking without undue 
                problem structuring, which is linked to success.</p>

        <section class="main-section" id="Limitations">
            <header class="titulos">Limitations</header>
            <p>Limitations of user stories include:</p>
            <ul class="orden-2">
                <li class="lista-1"><strong>Scale-up problem</strong>: User stories written on small physical cards are hard to maintain, difficult to scale to large projects and troublesome for geographically distributed teams.</li>
                <li class="lista-1"><strong>Vague, informal and incomplete</strong>: User story cards are regarded as conversation starters. Being informal, they are open to many interpretations. Being brief, they do not state all of the details necessary to implement a feature. Stories are therefore inappropriate for reaching formal agreements or writing legal contracts.</li>
                <li class="lista-1"><strong>Lack of non-functional requirements</strong>: User stories rarely include performance or non-functional requirement details, so non-functional tests (e.g. response time) may be overlooked.</li>
                <li class="lista-1"><strong>Don't necessarily represent how technology has to be built</strong>: Since user stories are often written from the business perspective, once a technical team begins to implement it may find that technical constraints require effort which may be broader than the scope of an individual story. Sometimes splitting stories into smaller ones can help resolve this. Other times, 'technical-only' stories are most appropriate. These 'technical-only' stories may be challenged by the business stakeholders as not delivering value which can be demonstrated to a customer/stakeholders.</li>

            <div class="story-mapping"><img class="story-mapping-2" src="img/story_mapping.jpg" width="100px" alt="">A story map in action, with epics on the top to structure stories</div>
            <p>In many contexts user stories are used and also summarized in groups for semantic and 
                organizational reasons. The different usages depend on the point-of-view, e.g. either 
                looking from a user perspective as product owner in relation to features or a company 
                perspective in relation to task organization.</p>
            <p>While some suggest to use 'epic' and 'theme' as labels for any thinkable kind of grouping 
                of user stories, organization management tends to use it for strong structuring and 
                uniting work loads. For instance, Jira seems to use a hierarchically organized to-do-list, 
                in which they named the first level of to-do-tasks 'user-story', the second level 'epics' 
                ( grouping of user stories ) and the third level 'initiatives' ( grouping of epics ). 
                However, initiatives are not always present in product management development and just add 
                another level of granularity. In Jira, 'themes' exist ( for tracking purposes ) that allow 
                to cross-relate and group items of different parts of the fixed hierarchy.</p>
            <p>In this usage, Jira, shifts the meaning of themes in an organization perspective: 
                e.g how much time did we spent on developing theme "xyz". But another definition of themes is: 
                a set of stories, epics, features etc for a user that forms a common semantic unit or goal. 
                There is probably not a common definition because different approaches exist for different 
                styles of product design and development. In this sense, some also suggest to not use any kind 
                of hard groups and hierarchies.</p>
                <p><strong>Epic</strong></p>
                <p>Large stories or multiple user stories that are very closely related are summarized as epics. 
                    A common explanation of epics is also: a user story that is too big for a sprint.</p>
                <p><strong>Initiative</strong></p>
                <p>Multiple epics or stories grouped together hierarchically, mostly known from Jira.</p>
                <p><strong>Theme</strong></p>
                <p>Multiple epics or stories grouped together by a common theme or semantic relationship.</p>

            <header class="titulos">Story map</header>
            <div class="img-story-map"><img class="img-story-map-2" src="img/story_map.png" width="100px" alt="">User story mapping</div>
            <p>A story map organises user stories according to a narrative flow lthat presents the 
                big picture of the product. The technique was developed by Jeff Patton from 2005 to 
                2014 to address the risk of projects flooded with very detailed user stories that 
                distract from realizing the product's main objectives.</p>
            <p>User story mapping uses workshops with users to identify first the main business 
                activities. Each of these main activities may involve several kind of users or 
                personas.</p>
            <p>The horizontal cross-cutting narrative line is then drawn by identifying the main 
                tasks of the individual user involved in these business activities. The line is kept 
                throughout the project. More detailed user stories are gathered and collected as usual 
                with the user story practice. But each new user story is either inserted into the 
                narrative flow or related vertically to a main tasks.</p>
            <p>The horizontal axis corresponds to the coverage of the product objectives, and the vertical 
                axis to the needs of the individual users.</p>
            <p>In this way it becomes possible to describe even large systems without losing the big picture.</p>
            <p>Story maps can easily provide a two-dimensional graphical visualization of the 
                Product Backlog: At the top of the map are the headings under which stories are grouped, 
                usually referred to as 'epics' (big coarse-grained user stories), 'themes' 
                (collections of related user stories) or 'activities'. These are identified by orienting 
                at the user’s workflow or "the order you'd explain the behavior of the system". Vertically, 
                below the epics, the actual story cards are allocated and ordered by priority. The first 
                horizontal row is a "walking skeleton" and below that represents increasing sophistication.</p>

        <section class="main-section" id="User_journey_Map">
            <header class="titulos">User journey Map</header>
            <p>A user journey map intends to show the big picture but for a single user category. 
                Its narrative line focuses on the chronology of phases and actions that a single user 
                has to perform in order to achieve his or her objectives.</p>
            <p>This allows to map the user experience beyond a set of user stories. Based on user 
                feedback, the positive and negative emotions can be identified across the journey. 
                Points of friction or unfulfilled needs can be identified on the map. 
                This technique is used to improve the design of a product, allowing to engage users 
                in participatory approaches.</p>
